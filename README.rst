**Toolkit for Auditing and Mitigating Bias and Fairness**
**of Machine Learning Systems ðŸ”ŽðŸ¤–ðŸ§°**

*Responsibly* is developed for **practitioners** and **researchers** in mind,
but also for learners. Therefore, it is compatible with
data science and machine learning tools of trade in Python,
such as Numpy, Pandas, and especially **scikit-learn**.

The primary goal is to be one-shop-stop for **auditing** bias
and fairness of machine learning systems, and the secondary one
is to mitigate bias and adjust fairness through
**algorithmic interventions**.
Besides, there is a particular focus on **NLP** models.

*Responsibly* consists of three sub-packages:

1. ``responsibly.dataset``
     Collection of common benchmark datasets from fairness research.

2. ``responsibly.fairness``
     Demographic fairness in binary classification,
     including metrics and algorithmic interventions.

3. ``responsibly.we``
     Metrics and debiasing methods for bias (such as gender and race)
     in word embedding.

For fairness, *Responsibly*'s functionality is aligned with the book
`Fairness and Machine Learning
- Limitations and Opportunities <https://fairmlbook.org>`_
by Solon Barocas, Moritz Hardt and Arvind Narayanan.
